I'll create a function for calculating stamp duty for Australian residential properties along with all the necessary components and documentation.

I've created a comprehensive Australian stamp duty calculator for your Vite, React, TypeScript setup. Here's what I've provided:

1. **TypeScript Implementation (stamp-duty-calculator.ts)**
   - Complete function for calculating stamp duty across all Australian states
   - Type definitions for inputs and outputs
   - Configurable JSON structure for rates and thresholds
   - Logic for handling first home buyer concessions and investor surcharges

2. **Documentation (stamp-duty-documentation.md)**
   - Detailed explanation of the calculator's functionality
   - Input and output specifications
   - Step-by-step explanation of the calculation process
   - Usage examples
   - Assumptions and limitations
   - State-specific notes

The calculator handles:
- Different stamp duty structures across all states and territories
- First home buyer concessions and exemptions
- Investor surcharges (primarily affecting foreign investors)
- Additional fees like transfer and mortgage registration fees

The implementation includes a flexible configuration structure (STAMP_DUTY_RATES) that can be easily updated as government rates change. The calculation logic accounts for the progressive nature of stamp duty rates and the various thresholds that apply in different states.

The documentation explains the assumptions made (Australian residential property, standard transactions) and outlines areas where additional inputs might be needed for a more comprehensive calculator (such as foreign resident status, property type, and special conditions).

Would you like me to walk you through any specific part of the implementation or make adjustments to any aspect of the calculator?
