# Property Finance Journey Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
1. **Initialize Vite Project with TypeScript**
   - Set up project with React, TypeScript, and Vite
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up folder structure as per guidelines

2. **Configure Material UI**
   - Install Material UI dependencies
   - Set up theme provider with initial theme (to be refined later)
   - Create responsive layout components

3. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up type definitions
   - Create basic contexts for state management
   - Implement routing (if needed)

## Phase 2: Property Search Experience
1. **Property Search Component**
   - Implement address input with autocomplete (using mock data initially)
   - Create UI for search results
   - Handle address selection

2. **Property Insights Card**
   - Display property details (image, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.)
   - Show property location
   - Display valuation estimate with confidence level

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Ensure components adapt well to different screen sizes
   - Optimize layout for mobile devices

## Phase 3: Financial Components
1. **Loan Options Component**
   - Implement deposit calculation UI
   - Display loan amount required
   - Show property price breakdown

2. **Financial Inputs**
   - Create form components for financial information
   - Implement validation logic
   - Add responsive design for mobile

## Phase 4: Integration & Refinement
1. **API Integration**
   - Replace mock data with actual PropTrack API calls
   - Implement error handling for API requests
   - Add loading states

2. **State Management**
   - Refine context providers
   - Ensure efficient state updates
   - Implement caching where appropriate

3. **UI Polish**
   - Refine animations and transitions
   - Ensure consistent styling across components
   - Implement accessibility improvements

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
1. **Testing Implementation**
   - Add unit tests for logic and hooks (100% coverage)
   - Component testing with React Testing Library
   - End-to-end testing for critical flows

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add memoization for expensive operations

3. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Prepare build configuration
   - Document deployment process
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline (if required)

## Review Points
- After Phase 1: Review project structure and foundation
- After Phase 2: Review property search and insights UI
- After Phase 3: Review financial components and calculations
- After Phase 4: Review API integration and state management
- After Phase 5: Final review before deployment

## Current Focus: Phase 1 & Initial Phase 2
- Setting up project structure
- Implementing the property search component
- Building the property insights card as shown in the screenshot
